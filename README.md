JorConsole
==========

About
-----

JorConsole aims to provide standard console IO to the JOR1K emulator.
The goal is to get a working JOR1K emulator running on a local system,
using local IO, instead of running in a web browser.

Running
--------

Ensure your submodules are up to date:

	git submodule update --init

Then simply run index.js from the top level directory (where this file is):

	node index.js
